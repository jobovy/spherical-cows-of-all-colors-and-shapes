# spherical-cows-of-all-colors-and-shapes

Using [`galpy`](https://github.com/jobovy/galpy)'s spherical DF functionality to compute various NFW-related DFs (including new NFW ergodic and Osipkov-Merritt approximations). See the Appendix of [Lane, Bovy, & Mackereth (2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.09699) (published or arXiv v2).

Included notebooks:
* [Power-law embedded in an NFW profile](notebooks/embedded-in-nfw.ipynb)
* [Self-consistent NFW DFs (ergodic, constant anisotropy, and Osipkov-Merritt)](notebooks/selfconsistent-nfw-dfs.ipynb)
